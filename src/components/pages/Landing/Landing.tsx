          This interactive crash-course for React State Management aims to cover
          some concepts around component composition and help visualise its
          effect on state management and application performance.

          I recommend running this app in development mode with the React
          Devtools Profiler turned on (enable highlights on re-render) to see
          the impacts visualised.
